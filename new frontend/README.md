# Description

This is my final project for the Drake Full Stack Web Development course. It is intended to be a small, lightweight rpg-style dungeon where you move around a single screen, collect weapons, and fight monsters.

## Features

Implemented item equip system and 'loot pool' of items pulled from when entering a room

! Notably, any form of combat encounter is absent from this game due to time constraints, largely leaving it incomplete.

## Setup instructions

git clone the repo, and then open it within your ide

open two terminals, cd one to "new backend" then run
npm install
npm run dev

cd the other terminal into "new frontend" and run
npm install
npm run dev

follow the local host created by the frontend, and the application should be running.
